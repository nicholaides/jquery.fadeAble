fadeAble is a jquery image fading  plugin that is different for a number of reasons

1. You only add one image to your html
2. You specify the additional images when you initialize the plugin so they are added 
later. This still gives some time for preloading while not cause your pages to need 4 
images from the get go

Thats all for now. More to come.
